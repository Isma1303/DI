    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="justified-text">
      Aquí tienes tu historia en inglés con la importancia de tu familia
      incluida y un estilo más inspirador I am 19 years old and currently in my
      second year of university, studying Systems Engineering. Technology has
      always been my passion. My love for technology started as far back as I
      can remember. As a child, I wasn't just fascinated by video games I wanted
      to understand how they worked. I would analyze every detail, trying to
      uncover the magic behind the screens. As I grew older, I also discovered
      another side of myself a competitive spirit and a deep passion for sports,
      especially soccer. At just 15, I had the incredible opportunity to play
      professionally for Deportivo Mixco in Guatemala. However, at 18, I had to
      make a difficult decision to leave my soccer career behind and embrace a
      new chapter of my life. But this change led me to something even greater.
      It gave me the opportunity to focus on my education, develop my interest
      in technology, and dive deeper into my field. During my high school years,
      I learned so much and unknowingly developed skills that would prove
      essential in university. High school also introduced me to some of the
      most important people in my life my best friends and my girlfriend amazing
      individuals who have each contributed in their own way to my journey.
      However, none of this would have been possible without the unwavering
      support of my family. My parents have been my greatest role models, always
      encouraging me to chase my dreams, no matter how big they seemed. Their
      sacrifices and guidance have shaped the person I am today. My siblings
      have also played a crucial role in my life, constantly inspiring me and
      pushing me to be better. Their support has been my foundation, reminding
      me that no matter what challenges I face, I am never alone. University has
      been a rollercoaster of growth and discovery. Not only have I enhanced my
      academic skills, but I've also had incredible experiences including
      recording a commercial! I've met amazing classmates who have supported me
      through all my crazy ideas. I successfully completed my first year of
      engineering, and now, in my second year, I continue to explore new skills,
      such as application development. The year 2025 has been full of surprises,
      but the most unexpected one has been Destination Imagination. It caught me
      off guard, but it has also been the experience I've enjoyed the most.
      Through every challenge and every success, my family has been there,
      reminding me that with passion, perseverance, and the right support,
      anything is possible.
